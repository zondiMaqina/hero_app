# Hero App

This is the first FNB Academy coding project we get for week 2. The application is built only out of html for the structure and css for the styling os the web page.

## Structure of App

### Images
The images used for the application can be accssed from the public repository from [IT Varsity](https://github.com/IT-varsity-Materials/AppAcademyWeek2.git).

There are stored in my [images folder](./images/)

### Styling

For the styling of the web application i used the famous CSS, no frameworks included...yet :/

Since the web application will be available to different users (who will be using different browsers with different default styling agents) I have used the modern CSS reset file (made by other genius programmers).

- [CSS resetting file](./styling/normalize.css)
- [my CSS styling file](./styling/styles.css)

## Development

For the production of the web application i have used git with github where i commited changes locally using git (on my machine) then i pushed everything to github.

### Challanges

1. For unzipping or installing the files i first used the terminal command below to actually clone the repository that had the photos which then downloaded the repository or copied it into my machine

```git clone https://github.com/IT-varsity-Materials/AppAcademyWeek2.git```

2. Then i has to install the unzip tool to unzip the folder that had the images, using the sudo package installer in the terminal

```sudo apt-get unzip```

3. Then i proceeded to unzip the images to my images folder

```unzip [the_zipped_folder_name] -d [the_destination]```
